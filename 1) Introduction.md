The role-playing video game Parallel was created by Owen Chen, Omer Hussein, Cyrus Abhary, and Weicheng Pan. The game was written by Owen Chen and designed by Cyrus Abhary, Omer Hussein, and Owen Chen.

Parallel takes place in a fictional city's seaside area, which is still recovering from a bombing that occurred decades prior to the start of the game. Players take on the role of an alcoholic detective sloving a murder investigation. He begins to remember details of what transpired the night before and the current forces attempting to influence the city of Slovoke as the investigation progresses. Parallel was created for the most outstanding teacher, "Mr. Deslauries."

In the unconventional role-playing game Parallel, there is little to no actual combat. Instead, events are resolved through skill checks and dialogue via a system of 4 skills representing different aspects of the protagonist, such as his Intelligence and motor skills. Instead, a system of four skills representing various facets of the protagonist, such as his intelligence and motor skills are used to resolved events that occur. In addition, a system called "Mind" represents his other ideologies and personality traits, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them.  The game is based on the Text-Based game, "Zork."

Thank you for reading and I hope we give you the experience of a lifetime!
