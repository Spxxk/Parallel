# Parellel
Game for the best teacher!

Imagine waking up with no memory. No memory of the previous night, no memory of what happened, not even a memory of your current location.
amnesia induced by a hangover. You awaken in your battered hotel room, pantsless and drunk, with a breeze coming in through the window and hot water endlessly flowing from the bathroom faucet after a depressing struggle with your psyche.

Parellel mercilessly forces you into a gruesome, corrupt world where you play as a drug dealer/detective (you can't remember what happened last night) after you manage to put on your flared pants and funky jacket. It turns out that your friend "Glenn's room" contains a bloated body that is hanging from a celling fan. You and your more reserved co-partner are responsible for learning the truth (Brent). The events of last night were also clouded by alcoholism and a crisis, in addition to the murder.

Your first task is to decide what kind of character you'll be in the worn-out, made-up city of Slomland before starting your whodunit. You might prefer a character type that is more intelligent but has poorer social skills. Or perhaps you'll adopt a more forceful strategy, intimidating people with your physical presence to learn their secrets. However, you can only devote a certain number of skill points to your protagonist, so you must choose which qualities to emphasise.

If you roll a low number, for example, you might not be able to get away from a bunch if thugs. On the other hand, a high roll might provide you with important access to confidential information or information. This particular feature is what makes Parellel distinctive. A high roll when interacting with NPCs (non-player characters) might reveal more details about the murder or grant you more control over a key character. A poor roll could make you feel depressed and even change how someone will treat you in subsequent encounters.
