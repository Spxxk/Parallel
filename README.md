# Parellel
Game for the best teacher!

Imagine waking up with no memory. No memory of the previous night, no memory of what happened, not even a memory of your current location.
amnesia induced by a hangover. You awaken in your battered hotel room, pantsless and drunk, with a breeze coming in through the window and hot water endlessly flowing from the bathroom faucet after a depressing struggle with your psyche.

Parellel mercilessly forces you into a gruesome, corrupt world where you play as a drug dealer/detective (you can't remember what happened last night) after you manage to put on your flared pants and funky jacket. It turns out that your friend "Glenn's room" contains a bloated body that is hanging from a celling fan. You and your more reserved co-partner are responsible for learning the truth (Brent). The events of last night were also clouded by alcoholism and a crisis, in addition to the murder.

Your first task is to decide what kind of character you'll be in the worn-out, made-up city of Slomland before starting your whodunit. You might prefer a character type that is more intelligent but has poorer social skills. Or perhaps you'll adopt a more forceful strategy, intimidating people with your physical presence to learn their secrets. However, you can only devote a certain number of skill points to your protagonist, so you must choose which qualities to emphasise.

If you roll a low number, for example, you might not be able to get away from a bunch if thugs. On the other hand, a high roll might provide you with important access to confidential information or information. This particular feature is what makes Parellel distinctive. A high roll when interacting with NPCs (non-player characters) might reveal more details about the murder or grant you more control over a key character. A poor roll could make you feel depressed and even change how someone will treat you in subsequent encounters.

The game's combat is handled through skill checks and dialogue trees rather than traditional combat. The game's four main skills are intellect, psyche, physique, and motor skills. Numerous unique secondary skills complement each ability. By levelling up, the player gains skill points that help them advance in these areas. The choice of attire worn by the player-character can have both favourable and unfavourable effects on specific skills. The player character's ability to pass skill checks based on random dice rolls is improved by upgrading these skills, but doing so may have unfavourable character effects and discourage minmaxing. For instance, a player character with a high Drama score might be adept at spotting and making up lies, but they might also be more prone to fits of hysteria and paranoia. Similar to high Electrochemistry, substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviours may result from it even though it protects the player character from the negative effects of drugs and gives them knowledge about them.

Thoughts can be unlocked by having conversations with other characters and by having internal monologues with the player character. The player can then "internalise" a thought for a predetermined number of in-game hours, which, when successful, bestows permanent advantages but can also occasionally have unfavourable effects on the player character. Only a few slots are initially available in the Inventory; however, as experience levels rise, more become available.

The various skills also factor into the dialogue trees, causing the player-character to engage in internal conflict with one aspect of their body or mind and giving the impression that they are speaking to a disjointed persona. Depending on the skill points invested in the skill, these internal conversations may offer advice or additional insight that can direct the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters. For instance, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire, the player-character may come into situations where they may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance.
