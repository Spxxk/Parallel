Parallel an open-world role-playing game with heavy dialogue. The video game is shown (2d or 3d; got ta see if we can do 3d even though it is impossible). A drug-addicted, alcoholic detective investigates his best friend's murder. Players can switch rooms and move the detective to interact with highlighted NPCs and objects. Early in the game, they have a partner who acts as the protagonist's voice of professionalism which may help with dialogue. For example, our protagonist is friends with Brent Baldwin. 

Skill checks and dialogue replace combat in the game. Intellect, psyche, physique, and motor skills make up the game. Levelling up gives players skill points to improve in these areas. Player-character clothing can enhance or hinder specific skills. Upgrading these skills improves the player character's skill checks based on random dice rolls. Still, it may have adverse character effects and discourage min-maxing. For example, a player character with high Intelligence may be good at lying but also prone to hysteria and paranoia. A high physical level protects the player's character from the harmful effects of drugs. It gives them knowledge about themselves but can also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviours.

"Mind" is Parellel's secondary inventory system. Talking to other characters and talking to yourself unlocks thoughts. When the player character "internalizes" an idea, they will receive permanent benefits, but there may also be drawbacks. Experience levels unlock more slots in the "Mind." The "Mind" considers selling drugs in the "Och" thought. The character loses composure around NPCs while thinking. After "Och," nature can sell drugs.

Due to the four skills, the player-character may appear to speak to a disjointed persona in dialogue. These internal conversations may offer advice or insight to guide the player's actions or discussion with the game's non-playable characters, depending on skill points invested. If the player accepts this suggestion when debating physique, physique, which represents strength and pain threshold, may appear in situations where the player-character needs to fight or is extremely inebriated or on drugs.

Wow that was quite a bit but it will all make sense soon!
